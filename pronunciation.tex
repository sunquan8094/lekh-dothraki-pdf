\section*{Epenthesis}
Epenthesis is the addition of a sound to a word in order to make pronunciation
easier. Dothraki has a few rules regarding epenthesis:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Words must not end in \textbf{w}, \textbf{g}, or \textbf{q}. Add an extra \textbf{e} to the
				end should this occur.
	\item Words must not end in double (geminate) consonants.
        Add an extra \textbf{e} to the end should this occur.
	\item Given an arbitrary consonant \textbf{C}, words must not end in
				\textbf{Cw}, \textbf{Cr}, \textbf{Cl}, or \textbf{Cy}.
				Add an extra \textbf{e} to the end should this occur.
\end{itemize}
There are exceptions to this rule:
\begin{itemize}
	\item When nouns end with the pattern \textbf{CCV}. Such a noun is classified as
				irregular.
\end{itemize}
