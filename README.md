Building the PDF
---
#### Mac OS X
You should have the following installed on your machine before you begin to build:
- TeXLive via MacPorts (`sudo port install texlive`)
  - Extra Packages: `texlive-fonts-extra`

When you have all this, you can just execute the Makefile.

#### Windows
Personally, I haven't tried building on Windows yet, but I'd open `document.tex` in your favorite TeX editor and use its build function.
