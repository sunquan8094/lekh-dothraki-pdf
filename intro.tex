\section*{What is Dothraki?}
Dothraki is a language spoken by the Dothraki people in the George R. R. Martin
series \textit{A Song of Ice and Fire}, and its world-famous television adaptation
\textit{Game of Thrones}.
\section*{Why learn Dothraki?}
Dothraki has quite a fanbase for a conlang created for a TV series or movie. In my
opinion, it wouldn't hurt to try it. You create your own limits.
\section*{How to Read This Book}
I purposefully chose to use a sans serif font, so that everyone (who speaks English,
of course) can read this book without difficulty. Here's just a couple more things regarding font:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Dothraki words will be \textbf{boldfaced}
	\item Pronunciation approximations will be \underline{underlined}.
	\item Abbreviations for parts of speech will be \textit{italicized}.
\end{itemize}
Here is the list of abbreviations we will be using and their corresponding equivalents:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textit{na}: animate noun
	\item \textit{ni}: inanimate noun
	\item \textit{pn}: pronoun
	\item \textit{vb-at}: \textbf{-at} verb
  \item \textit{vb-lat}: \textbf{-lat} verb
	\item \textit{adj}: adjective
 	\item \textit{prep}: preposition
	\item \textit{conj}: conjunction
\end{itemize}
